                    <p>For 12 weeks, I paired with a team of four developers to build our feature for the Surface Hub: an 84 inch smart board meant to facilitate corporate and creative teams through visual collaboration.  While the details of this project are confidential, I can convey my process and contributions which ultimately show how I grew as a designer.

                    <h3>FORMING A BRIEF</h3>
                    
                    <p>
                    I realized early on that my team’s developers were integral in making product decisions as they offered technical as well as usability considerations. I began by writing a project brief that could serve both the developers and myself in our decision making. Who are we helping and what is their problem? Why is it worth solving? How are we helping? What forms could our solution take on? What are our milestones?
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>During my research, I found it most useful to look at how teams around me were using whiteboards, given the Surface Hub helps teams to visually collaborate. I documented the tasks they performed while observing body gestures and social interactions. Here’s what I found:
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        <b>Drawing on a whiteboard supplements our words, even mid sentence.</b>
                        <br>
                            <b>Ideas made visible survive longer in group discussions.</b>
                        <br>
                            <b>The colors of markers hold specific meanings to each team.</b>
                    </p>
                    
                    

                    
                    
                    
                    <h3>PROTOTYPING</h3>
                
                    <p>Identifying patterns in my observations helped me reach solutions to the human problems established in our brief. I chose physical prototyping where I sketched and glued together full size paper mockups. Prototyping at full-scale helped me realize the need to bring touch targets close together in order to save the user from making excessive gestures across the 84 inch screen. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2>I obsessed over the ergonomic considerations of the device to find new opportunities for prototypes that were both efficient and delightful. </h2>
                    
                    <img class="span_image" src="images/SurfaceHub/whiteboard.jpg">
                    
                    <p>Product critiques were a regular part of our 12 week timeline. I was a part our team’s daily scrums, weekly sprint meetings, and product demos for the greater Surface Hub team. At each of these levels, critiques helped us to prioritize problems and make new considerations. When it came time to give feedback to other teams, I made a habit of giving only feedback that was critical and actionable. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2>I learned to present my work in a format that showed clarity and solid reasoning.</h2> 
                            
                    <h3>TEST + ITERATE</h3>
                    
                    <p>User testing was limited to Microsoft employees due to the project’s confidentiality. Thankfully our feature was widely applicable to the workflows of most internal teams at the Vancouver office, allowing us to collect valuable feedback. I found “over-the-shoulder” testing to be the most fruitful in discovering usability problems. Running user-testing sessions near the end of each week helped us clarify our future sprint goals and realize which components were successful.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2>It was deeply rewarding to see folks naturally integrate my prototype into their own team collaborations.</h2>
                    
                    <h3>OUTCOME</h3>
 
                    <p>At the end of our 12 weeks, we transferred our project to the Surface Hub team. I ensured that all my research and decisions were well documented for the benefit of future designers working on this project. Our prototypes demonstrated both the design and implementation possibilities of the device. This is where I believe my team made the biggest impact. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    What I gained from my experience of working in a team of non-designers was invaluable. While I took ownership over much of our product’s design, my team of developers were greatly involved in the design process. This inclusive approach helped me understand many different viewpoints rather than designing in a vacuum. I was very fortunate to be designing for such a physically based product as it meant that I could utilize everything I had previously learned about industrial design and ergonomics. Translating my prototypes into a real working feature demanded a cyclical interaction between developers and myself - a proficiency I learned entirely from this internship. Importantly, I began to see the greater value of teams: these are powerful systems, not just groups of expert individuals. Lastly, I built my confidence as a product designer. Being responsible for larger and more complex problems taught me to manage pressures and advocate for my ideas.
